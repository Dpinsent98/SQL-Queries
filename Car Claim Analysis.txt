The SQL code analyzes car insurance claim data by calculating the total number of claims, 
the average claim amount, identifying the top reasons for claims, 
and listing the top 10 customers with the highest claim frequency.

-- Calculate the total number of claims
SELECT
    COUNT(ClaimID) AS TotalClaims
FROM Claims;

-- Calculate the average claim amount
SELECT
    AVG(ClaimAmount) AS AverageClaimAmount
FROM Claims;

-- Identify the most common reasons for claims
SELECT
    Reason,
    COUNT(ClaimID) AS NumberOfClaims
FROM Claims
GROUP BY Reason
ORDER BY NumberOfClaims DESC
LIMIT 5; -- Show the top 5 reasons for claims

-- List customers with the highest number of claims
SELECT
    C.CustomerID,
    C.CustomerName,
    COUNT(ClaimID) AS NumberOfClaims
FROM Customers C
JOIN Policies P ON C.CustomerID = P.CustomerID
JOIN Claims Cl ON P.PolicyID = Cl.PolicyID
GROUP BY C.CustomerID, C.CustomerName
ORDER BY NumberOfClaims DESC
LIMIT 10; -- Show the top 10 customers with the highest number of claims
